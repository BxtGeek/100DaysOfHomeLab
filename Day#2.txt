Day#2 of #100DaysOfHomeLab

So yesterday I setup my docker host. Today I play around with the portainer. Having some issue while installing the portainer. But at last it is install. 

ðŸ§µ Thead Ahead

Also planning to create a single vagrant file to setup a docker host and install portainer into that. That will be so fun.
